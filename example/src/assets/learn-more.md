# What are Data Rewards?
In principal it's quite straightforward, you have data that businesses want. Many of these businesses are willing to pay you for the legal rights to use it.

**Q: But don't they already just take it?**  
A: Yes, and no. There are several reasons why businesses prefer to legally source data direct from users. There's certain data you have that they can't easily or affordably acquire. The laws around data privacy are radidly changing and this is a lower risk, more sustainable process. And ultimately, data as with anything, straight from the source, is better and cheaper.

## How does it work?
Once you opt-in to the program, you will see a list of offers for actions you can take to exchange your data for a reward.

Offers can vary in the types of data, the payout, and the requirements associated. For example, some actions are one-time like taking a photo of a receipt. Where others may require linking your Amazon account for 90 days. 

Data for the program is never automatically collected without your knowledge. You must perform an explicit action to license your data and receive said reward.

## What rewards are available?
Data rewards are tallied in the form of reward points, similar to something like airline miles. Each offer details the action required, the reward amount, and if there are any additional requirements. 

**The conversion rate is $1 USD = 1,000 points.**

*Example:*

### How do I get paid?
Just press the Redeem button to begin the withdrawl process to convert your points into cashback. Depending on your account and settings a withdrawl may be subject to a minimum balance or other program participation minimums.

## What happens to my data?

When you agree to participate in the Data Rewards program a Data License is created specifying how data can be exchanged and used.

**At this point, none of your data is actually exchanged, only the legal terms and rights are set.** 

If you decide to perform one or more of the rewarded actions detailed in the offer(s), only the data required for fulfilment of the offer is uploaded, and used solely in accordance with your Data License.

### What is a Data License?

A Data License declares your ownership over a given set of data, specifying the terms, conditions, and compensation for the use of said dataset.

In essence, it's a legal agreement that a) ensures your fair compensation for your data and b) contractually obligates businesses to only utilize your data for use cases explicitly defined. 

### Can I change my mind?

Of course! Since the Data Reward program only works on explicit actions, just stop performing rewarded actions and unlink any connected accounts. Or, if you want to completely opt-out of the program, just contact our support team, and we will terminate your Data License. 

It's important to note that you are legally licensing your data for fair compensation meaning there are no takebacksies on past trades. For example, if you bought an apple for $1 and then ate it, you can't request your $1 back from the vendor, but you can definitely not buy any more apples. 

The same logic applies here, you can't take back the data you exchanged, but you can absolutely stop exchanging any more data.

### What if I don't participate?

Participation is **100% optional**. Declining to participate will not negatively impact your current experience.
